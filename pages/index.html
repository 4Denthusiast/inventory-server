        <p>This website is part of the game Dissection. It is not intended to be playable on its own, so if you've somehow found this page but are not involved in the game, I don't expect it to make sense. If you are involved, use one of the links to get started. I recommend having this website open on a full-size computer, not a phone, and make sure you can access it and Discord at the same time, or at least very easily switch back and forth between the two, because we'll be using both during the game.</p>
